            This PR contains the latest updates to the Python SDK documentation.

            The SDK doc generation will not change the docs.json for new or removed files, so you will need to manually commit a change to this PR for any file changes.

            When reviewing this PR, please do the following:

            - [ ] If there are any new files added by the PR, add them to the docs.json file in the right location
            - [ ] If there are any files removed by the PR, remove them from the docs.json
            - [ ] Launch the docs and check for any file path errors
            - [ ] If any SDK docs are removed, check why - this should not happen. If the docstrings are wrong they should be fixed, not removed
            - [ ] For added docs, check they are correct (e.g. match the function signature)

            **DO NOT** approve this PR until you have completed these checks.
